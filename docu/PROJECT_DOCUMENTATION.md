## 2) Abstract

The AI-Powered Resume Screener Bot is a comprehensive, intelligent recruitment automation system that leverages cutting-edge artificial intelligence technologies to revolutionize the hiring process. This innovative solution integrates multiple AI models including OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Gemini to provide sophisticated resume analysis, candidate evaluation, and bias detection capabilities.

The system addresses critical challenges in modern recruitment including time-consuming manual resume screening, unconscious bias in candidate evaluation, and the need for data-driven hiring decisions. By implementing advanced natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, the platform automatically analyzes resumes, extracts key information, matches candidates to job requirements, and provides comprehensive scoring and recommendations.

Key innovations include automated bias detection that identifies and mitigates gender, age, location, and educational biases, blind recruitment features for fair screening, and an intelligent HR assistant chatbot that enables natural language queries about candidates. The system features a modern, responsive web interface with beautiful animations and intuitive user experience, making advanced AI capabilities accessible to HR professionals and recruiters.

Built on a robust Flask backend and React frontend architecture, the platform demonstrates production-ready software engineering practices with comprehensive error handling, security measures, and scalable design patterns. This project represents a significant advancement in AI-powered recruitment technology, offering organizations a powerful tool to enhance hiring efficiency while promoting fairness and objectivity in candidate selection.

### 8. Code Highlights

#### **API Integration Logic**
```python
# backend/services/openai_service.py
def analyze_candidate_with_ai(self, resume_text, job_description):
    """Analyze candidate using OpenAI GPT-4"""
    prompt = f"""
    Analyze this resume for the position: {job_description}
    
    Resume: {resume_text}
    
    Provide:
    1. Overall score (0-100)
    2. Key strengths
    3. Areas for improvement
    4. Cultural fit assessment
    """
    
    response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=0.3
    )
    
    return self.parse_ai_response(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

#### **Chatbot Response Processing**
```javascript
// frontend/src/services/api.js
export const sendHRChat = async (message) => {
  try {
    const response = await api.post('/api/hr-chat', {
      message,
      context: getConversationContext()
    });
    
    return {
      response: response.data.response,
      candidates: response.data.candidates || [],
      actions: response.data.suggested_actions || []
    };
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error('Chat service unavailable');
  }
};
```

#### **Frontend Chat Component**
```javascript
// frontend/src/components/HRAssistant.js
const HRAssistant = () => {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [isTyping, setIsTyping] = useState(false);
  
  const sendMessage = async (message) => {
    setIsTyping(true);
    const result = await sendHRChat(message);
    
    setMessages(prev => [...prev, {
      type: 'bot',
      content: result.response,
      candidates: result.candidates
    }]);
    
    setIsTyping(false);
  };
  
  return (
    <ChatContainer>
      <MessageList messages={messages} />
      {isTyping && <TypingIndicator />}
      <MessageInput onSend={sendMessage} />
    </ChatContainer>
  );
};
```
