#### Code Style

##### Python
```python
def analyze_resume(resume_text: str, job_description: str = "") -> dict:
    """
    Analyze a resume using AI models.
    
    Args:
        resume_text: The extracted text from the resume
        job_description: Optional job description for better matching
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing analysis results
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

##### JavaScript/React
```javascript
const CandidateCard = ({ candidate, onSelect }) => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    onSelect(candidate.id);
  }, [candidate.id, onSelect]);
  
  return (
    <div className="card" onClick={handleClick}>
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Testing
